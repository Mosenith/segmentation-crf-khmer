# khmer-crf-segmentation
Word segmentation using Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for Khmer document

This project includes Python notebook that has the complete code to run the CRF. The notebook has code that include the process to download/extract the data and train the model.

If you open this from Google Colab, you can run right away without any further setup. I develop using Colab.
