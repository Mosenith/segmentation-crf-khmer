# khmer-crf-segmentation
Word segmentation using Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for Khmer document

This project includes Python notebook that has the complete code to run the CRF. The notebook includes code to download/extract the data and trains the model.

* CRF-Khmer-Segmentation.ipynb: Implementation using CRF
* HMM_Khmer_Segmentaion.ipynb: Using Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
* sklearn_Khmer_segmentation.ipynb: Naive Bayes and other sklearn algorithms 
(Random Forest and Linear Regression got to 93%, Naive Bayes is around 89%)

If you open this from Google Colab, you can run right away without any further setup.
